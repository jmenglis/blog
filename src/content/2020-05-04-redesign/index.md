I decided to upgrade to the latest version of [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org).  With that I began a redesign of the site to make it even more minimal than before.

My main page will just list the details of the blog and I am going to attempt to be practical with my posts to help developers around the world learn new techniques or rehash old ones.

I hope you enjoy and I hope you staying safe during Coronavirus.
