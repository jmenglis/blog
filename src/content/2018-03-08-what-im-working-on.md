Lately I have been attempting to accomplish a tight rope act by cramming a lot of knowledge into my brain.  This has been a real big PITA.  

So here are a list of the things I am working on learning as a now 2+ years removed bootcamp graduate.

- Apache Spark (PySpark) - This is for organizing a data pipeline for either big data analysis or machine learning
- Tensorflow - I think this one speaks for itself.
- Keras is a high level layer that sits on top of Tensorflow and takes a lot of the baggage code and makes it simpler.
- C... [Yes I am learning-c-the-hard-way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/).  I wanted to take a step back as a bootcamp graduate and learn about memory management, pointers, data structures and algorithms.  I am 13 or so exercises in and just getting to the the juicy stuff.  This will have a follow on blog detailing my fun with C.

As you have probably noticed I am highly focused on more services related items that deal with structuring, processing, handling, and analyzing data.  Data has always been fascinating to me as it holds a lot of hidden secrets.
