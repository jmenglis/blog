The past few months have been hard transitioning from being in an office to working from home.  It can be really hard to disconnect and find time to learn.  The constant feeling  of tunnel vision as you transition from one computer, work, to the next, personal.

There are a few measures I am trying to make in my life to help with the balance of learning new things or working on side projects.

1. Make a conscious effort daily to take time away from technology.
    - This really helps with focus for me.  I find if I am consistently in front of a screen I begin to lose focus easily.
    - Try taking a walk, working out, reading a book, meditating, or journaling.
2. Have conversations with friends and family.
    - I find my stress levels are higher when I do not get the opportunity to have conversations with friends/family.
    - Set aside specific time of the day to talk with a family member or friend.
3. Find a hobby outside of technology.
    - It is easier for me to learn new skills like cooking or perfecting my Chemex or v60 pour overs.

I know this is probably not what you came to read, but for me I need these things to keep me centered and to help break up my day and keep my brain fresh.
