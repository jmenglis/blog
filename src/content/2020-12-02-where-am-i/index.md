Interestingly enough it has been a while since I've last posted here, and I think it would be wise of me to use this
as a space to write about some new things I am learning about.  I've taken a course in Java, and I am working on finishing up
Intermediate Object Oriented Programming in Java.  Next up I will be taking Advanced Data Structures and Algos with the goal
of joining an online Master's program.

My COVID day job still has me at AWS with the [Amazon Fraud Detector](https://aws.amazon.com/fraud-detector/) team.  We are
working on adding new customer centric features.  

I also became a slightly bored and bought an 2002 Suzuki SV650 motorcycle in early summer and will soon be adding 
tutorials to help with showing common maintenance.

Let's keep in touch, if anyone actually reads this stuff anymore.
